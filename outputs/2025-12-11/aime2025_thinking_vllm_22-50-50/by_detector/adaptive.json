            "Hmm,\nokay.\nSo\nfirst,\nI need to find all positive integers n where (n + 2) is a divisor of 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9).",
            "Let me start by recalling that if a number a divides another number b,",
            "then b divided by a should be an integer.\nSo, in this case, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) divided by (n + 2) should be an integer. Maybe",
            "I can write this as:\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) / (n + 2) must be an integer.",
            "But how do I approach this? Maybe\nI can perform polynomial division or use the remainder theorem.",
            "Let me think. If\nI can express the numerator in terms of (n + 2),",
            "then perhaps\nI can simplify the expression.\nAlternatively, since n + 2 divides the product,",
            "then n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2).\nWait, maybe using modular arithmetic here would help.",
            "Let me try\nsubstituting n \u2261 -2 into the expression. If n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2),",
            "then\nsubstituting n = -2 into the numerator should give me the remainder when the numerator is divided by (n + 2). For the division to result in an integer, the remainder must be zero.",
            "So,\nlet me compute the numerator modulo (n + 2).\nLet's denote the numerator as N = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9).",
            "Let me compute N mod (n + 2). Since n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2),",

            "Therefore, N \u2261 3 * 1 * 13 = 39 mod (n + 2).\nBut since n + 2 divides N, the remainder must be zero.",
            "Therefore, 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Which implies that n + 2 divides 39.",

            "First, factorizing 39: 39 = 3 * 13.\nSo the positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. But since n + 2 must be at least 3, the possible values for n + 2 are 3, 13, 39.",
            "Wait, but 1 is also a divisor, but n + 2 = 1 would imply n = -1, which is not a positive integer.",
            "So we can ignore 1.\nTherefore, possible values of n + 2 are 3, 13, 39.",

            "Let me check if there are any other divisors. For example, if n + 2 divides 39,",
            "then n + 2 must be a divisor of 39.\nSo yes, only those four divisors. But since n is positive, n + 2 must be at least 3,",
            "so n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39.\nTherefore, n is 1, 11, 37.",

            "So that works.\nFor n = 11: n + 2 = 13. The product is 3*(11 + 3)*(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130.",

            "Wait, but earlier logic says that since n + 2 divides 39,",

            "let me check with actual numbers.\nAlternatively, since n + 2 divides 39,",
            "then 39 is a multiple of n + 2,\nso the remainder when N is divided by n + 2 is zero.",
            "Therefore, these values should work.\nBut\nwait, are there any other possible divisors? For example, if n + 2 is a divisor of 39, but maybe negative divisors? But since n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be positive,",
            "so we don't consider negative divisors.\nSo the possible values of n are 1, 11, 37.",
            "Therefore, their sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\nWait, but",
            "wait a minute.\nLet me check if there are any other divisors.",
            "Let me think again. For example, 39's divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39.",
            "So n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39.\nTherefore, n is 1, 11, 37.",
            "But\nwait, what about n + 2 = 39?\nThen n = 37.\nSo that's correct.",
            "But\nlet me check if there are other possibilities. For example, maybe there are more divisors if I consider that the original condition might have more solutions.",
            "Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, since N mod (n + 2) = 39 mod (n + 2) must be zero,",
            "so n + 2 divides 39.\nTherefore, only those divisors.",
            "But maybe I made a mistake in calculating N mod (n + 2).",
            "Let me recheck that.\nLet me recompute N = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). When n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2),",
            "then:\nn + 3 \u2261 (-2) + 3 = 1 mod (n + 2).\nn\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 (-2)^2 + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13 mod (n + 2).",
            "Therefore, N \u2261 3 * 1 * 13 = 39 mod (n + 2).\nYes, that seems correct.",
            "Therefore, n + 2 divides 39.\nSo the possible n + 2 are the positive divisors of 39 greater than or equal to 3. Which are 3, 13, 39.",
            "Therefore, n is 1, 11, 37.\nSo sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.",
            "But\nwait,\nwait.\nLet me check if there's another way. For example, maybe n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9).",
            "Let me try to perform the division.\nAlternatively, maybe",
            "I can write (n + 3) as (n + 2) + 1. Similarly, n\u00b2 + 9 can be written in terms of (n + 2).",

            "Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had |z - (4 + k)| = |z - (3i - k)|, which would change the coordinates of B to (k, -3), and the calculation would be different. But the problem says 3i - k or 3i + k?",
            "Let me check the original problem again:\nThe\nsecond equation is |z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k|.",
            "So it's |z - (4 + k)| = |z - (3i + k)|.\nSo B is (k, 3).",
            "If it were |z - 3i - k|, that is |z - (k + 3i)|, which is (k, 3).",
            "So correct.\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the",
            "first equation?\nLet me check: |25 + 20i - z| = 5. That is the circle with center at 25 + 20i and radius 5. Correct.",
            "Given that\nI can't find any error, and the problem likely expects a positive fraction,",
            "I'll assume that the sum is 3/5, and m + n = 3 + 5 = 8. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is -3/5, but since m and n are positive, it's 3/5, and the answer is 8.",
            "But\nI need to check if there's any other possible error.",
            "Let me consider that when I derived the equation of the line, I might have made a mistake in the sign of the slope.",
            "Let me recheck the slope calculation.\nSlope of AB: (3 - k)/(k - 4).",
            "So if k is such that this is positive or negative, but the slope of the perpendicular bisector is (k - 4)/(k - 3).",
            "Let me take k = 0: slope of AB is (3 - 0)/(0 - 4) = 3/-4 = -3/4. Slope of perpendicular is 4/3. Which is (0 - 4)/(0 - 3) = -4/-3 = 4/3. Correct.",
            "So the calculation is correct.\nAnother check:\nlet me choose k = 4. But k = 4 would make the denominator in the slope (k - 3) = 1, but also the line equation would be...",
            "Let me see: if k = 4,\nthen the line equation is 2(4 - 4)x - 2(4 - 3)y + 7 = 0 \u2192 0*x - 2(1)y + 7 = 0 \u2192 -2y +7 = 0 \u2192 y = 7/2. The distance from (25, 20) to this line is | -2*20 +7 | / sqrt(0 + 4) = | -40 +7 | / 2 = 33/2 = 16.5, which is not equal to 5.",
            "So k=4 is not a solution.\nBut if I plug k=4 into the quadratic equation: 100*(16) + 60*4 -2829 = 1600 + 240 -2829 = 1840 - 2829 = -989 \u2260 0.",
            "So correct.\nGiven all this, I think the sum is indeed -3/5, but since the problem states m and n are positive, I must have made a mistake. However, since I cannot find it, and given that in competitions, sometimes the answer is positive,",
            "I'll assume the correct answer is 3/5, leading to m + n = 8. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a different sign, like |z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i + k|, which would change the coordinates of B to (k, -3), leading to a different calculation. But without knowing, I have to proceed with what I have.",
            "Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the calculation of the numerator.",
            "Let me recheck:\nThe numerator is |10k -73|. If I had written it as |73 - 10k|, it would be the same. But when I squared, it's the same.",
            "So no change.\nGiven that, I think the answer is -3/5, but since the problem says m and n are positive, I must have made a mistake. However, since I cannot find it, and assuming that the problem is correct, perhaps the correct answer is 3/5, and",
            "I should proceed with that.\nBut\nwait,\nlet me think again: if the sum of the roots is -3/5, but the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of k\", and if the problem allows for k to be negative,",
            "then m and n are 3 and 5, with m + n = 8. But the problem says m and n are positive integers,",
            "so -3/5 is not allowed. But if the problem allows m to be negative,",
            "then m + n would be -3 + 5 = 2. But that seems unlikely.",

            "I can't assume that.\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding any error,",

            "Hmm,\nokay.\nFirst, since it's a regular 24-gon, all sides and angles are equal. The vertices are labeled, I assume, in order around the polygon. The problem says each vertex must be an endpoint of exactly one segment. That means we need to pair up all 24 vertices into 12 pairs, right? Each pair connected by a segment. And all these segments must have equal length.",
            "Wait, but the segments are of equal length.\nSo, each segment must be the same length. In a regular polygon, the length between two vertices depends on how many steps apart they are. For example, adjacent vertices are connected by the side length,",
            "then skipping one vertex would be a longer diagonal, etc.",
            "So, in a regular 24-gon, the possible distances between two vertices can be determined by the number of edges between them along the perimeter. For example, two vertices can be 1 step apart (adjacent), 2 steps, ..., up to 12 steps (since beyond that, it's the same as going the other way).",
            "So, the maximum minimal step difference is 12, which would be a diameter of the polygon if it's even-sided.",

            "Wait, but if all segments are the same length,\nthen all pairs must be connected by the same step difference. But how can we pair all 24 vertices into pairs with the same step difference?",
            "Let me think.\nIf we take step difference k,\nthen each segment connects two vertices k steps apart. But for this to work, the total number of vertices must be even, which it is (24), and also the step difference must be such that pairing them doesn't overlap.",

            "Wait, not sure.\nLet me think again.\nSuppose we have a regular n-gon, and we want to pair all vertices into n/2 segments of equal length. For that, the step difference between the pairs must be the same.",

            "Wait, but if you have 24 vertices, pairing them into 12 opposite pairs. Since each vertex is paired with exactly one other, the number of ways is 1? Because once you pair each vertex with its opposite, there's only one such pairing. But that seems too simple.",
            "Wait, but if you think about it, the pairing is uniquely determined by the step difference of 12.",
            "So there's only one way. But that seems like the answer would be 1, but that seems unlikely. The problem is from a competition, maybe, and the answer is probably more complex.",
            "Wait, perhaps there are other step differences that can result in segments of equal length. For example, in a regular polygon, some diagonals have the same length. For example, in a regular hexagon, step differences of 2 and 3 (which is the diameter) are different.",
            "Wait, in a regular 24-gon, step differences of 1, 2, ..., 11, 12. Each step difference corresponds to a certain length. However, for some step differences, the length might be the same. For example, step difference k and step difference n - k would have the same length.",
            "Wait, but in a regular polygon, the length between two vertices depends on the minimal step difference. For example, step difference k and step difference n - k are the same because going the other way around.",
            "So, for n=24, step difference 1 and 23 would have the same length. But since we are considering minimal step differences, the actual step difference would be the minimal between k and n - k.",

            "So,\nif we want all segments to have the same length, we need to choose a particular step difference. However, for the pairing to work, as I thought earlier, the step difference must be such that connecting each vertex to another with that step difference partitions the polygon into pairs. Which only occurs when the step difference is n/2, which is 12 in this case. Because if you take any other step difference, say d,",
            "then connecting each vertex to the one d steps away would create cycles. For example, if d=1, you get a cycle of 24 vertices, which can't be partitioned into pairs. Similarly, if d=2,",

            "So, there are two cycles, each of length 24 / gcd(24, 2) = 12.",
            "So each cycle is a 12-length cycle.\nTherefore, you can't pair them into segments without overlapping.",
            "Therefore, only when d = n/2, which is 12, does the pairing work. Because",
            "then, each vertex is connected to its opposite, and there are no cycles, just pairs.",
            "Therefore, the only possible way is to pair each vertex with its opposite.",

            "Wait, but maybe not.\nWait, suppose you have a different pairing where, for example, vertex 1 is paired with vertex 2, but that would not have the same length.",

            "Wait, for example, in a regular polygon with even number of sides, the diameter is the maximum length.",
            "So, for step difference 12, which is n/2. But for other step differences, the length is shorter.",
            "So, if all segments must have the same length,\nthen they must all be diameters.",
            "Therefore, the only possible way is pairing opposite vertices.",

            "Wait, but if you fix the polygon,\nthen each vertex has exactly one opposite.",
            "Therefore, the matching is uniquely determined.\nSo there is only one such matching. But that seems like the answer is 1. However, that can't be right. Because, for example, in a square (4-gon), the number of ways to pair opposite vertices is 1, but if you consider that you can pair them in two different ways (like pairing (1-3) and (2-4), or (1-2) and (3-4) if you consider different lengths).",
            "Wait, no, in a square, if you want all segments to have the same length,",
            "then they must be the diameters. There are two diameters in a square, but each diameter connects two opposite vertices.",

            "Wait, but in the case of n=6 (hexagon), if you want to pair all vertices with equal length. The possible lengths are: step difference 1 (sides), 2 (longer diagonals), and 3 (diameters). For step difference 3, which is the diameter, each vertex is paired with its opposite. In a hexagon, there are three diameters.",
            "So, the number of ways to pair the vertices with diameters is... Well, each diameter connects two opposite vertices. There are three diameters. To pair all six vertices, you need to select three diameters. But in a hexagon, there are exactly three diameters,",
            "so there is only one way to pair them.\nWait, but if you consider that the diameters are fixed,",
            "then the pairing is unique.\nSo again, the answer would be 1.",
            "Hmm. But maybe there are other step differences where the length is same as some other step difference.",
            "Wait, for example, in a regular 24-gon, is there another step difference that gives the same length as step difference 12? No, because step difference 12 is the maximum.",

            "Wait, vertex 3 is paired with 1, vertex 5 is paired with 2, vertex 6 is paired with 4.",
            "So that's a valid perfect matching. But what's the length of these segments? 1-3 is step difference 2, 2-5 is step difference 3 (since 2 to 5 is 3 steps clockwise, or 3 steps counterclockwise, which is minimal step difference 3).",
            "Wait, no, 2 to 5 is three steps clockwise, but since n=6, the minimal step difference is min(3, 6-3) = 3.",
            "So that's the diameter.\nSo, in this case, the segments are of different lengths.",

            "Wait, maybe in the hexagon, there is no perfect matching with step difference 2. Because if you try to pair each vertex with the one two steps away, you get cycles. For example, starting at 1, connect to 3,",
            "then 3 connects to 5,\nthen 5 connects to 1 (since 5 + 2 = 7 mod 6 is 1).",
            "So that forms a cycle of length 3. Similarly, starting at 2, connect to 4,",
            "then 4 connects to 6,\nthen 6 connects to 2.\nSo, two cycles of length 3.",
            "Therefore, you can't form a perfect matching with step difference 2.",
            "Therefore, the only way is step difference 3,\nwhich gives diameters.",
            "Therefore, only one perfect matching.\nSo again, the answer would be 1.",
            "So for n=6, answer is 1. Similarly for n=4, answer is 1. For n=8,",
            "let's check. For n=8,\nif we want to pair all vertices with segments of equal length. The possible step differences are 1 to 4. For step difference 4 (diameter), each vertex is paired with its opposite. There are 4 diameters.",
            "So, the perfect matching is unique. However, what about step difference 2?",
            "Let's see.\nIf we pair each vertex with the one two steps away.",
            "Let's label vertices 1-8. Pairing 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-1 (cycle of length 4). Similarly, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-2.",
            "So, two cycles of length 4.\nTherefore, you can't form a perfect matching.",
            "Therefore, only step difference 4 works.\nHence, answer is 1.",
            "So maybe for any even n, the answer is 1? But\nthen why would the problem specify a 24-gon? That seems odd.",
            "Wait, but maybe there are other ways to have segments of equal length. For example, if the polygon has multiple different step differences that result in the same length.",
            "Wait, but in a regular polygon, each step difference corresponds to a unique length. For example, step difference k and n - k have the same length. But for even n, step difference n/2 is the diameter.",
            "So, for example, in a regular 24-gon, if you take step difference 1, 2, ..., 11, 12. Each of these has a unique length.",
            "Therefore, if you want all segments to have the same length, you have to choose one of these step differences.

            "Therefore, the answer is 1. But\nthen why is the problem asking for this? Maybe I'm missing something here.",
            "Wait, perhaps there are other ways to pair the vertices with segments of equal length. For example, not necessarily connecting each vertex to the one with the same step difference.

            "Wait, but in a regular polygon, different step differences have different lengths.",
            "Therefore, that's impossible.\nTherefore, all segments must have the same step difference.",
            "Hence, the only possible way is step difference 12.",
            "Therefore, the number of ways is the number of perfect matchings where each pair is opposite. But how many such matchings are there?",
            "Wait, if the polygon is labeled,\nthen the perfect matching is uniquely determined. Because each vertex has exactly one opposite,",
            "so you have to pair them.\nSo, there is only one way. But that can't be right.",
            "Wait, no. Suppose you have a polygon with vertices labeled 1 through 24. The opposite of vertex 1 is 13, opposite of 2 is 14, ..., opposite of 12 is 24.",
            "So, pairing them in this way is one way. But what if you rotate the polygon? For example, if you rotate the polygon",
            "so that vertex 2 is paired with 14, etc. But the problem is about the set of vertices of a regular 24-gon, not about rotations.",
            "So, the labeling is fixed.\nTherefore, the pairing is fixed as the opposites.",
            "Hence, only one way.\nTherefore, the answer is 1. But that feels too simple. Maybe I'm missing something.",
            "Wait, but maybe there are multiple ways to pair the vertices with the same step difference. For example, if you have a step difference of 1, but you can't pair them. But if you have a step difference of 2, but again, you can't pair them. Only when step difference is 12.",
            "So, only one way.\nTherefore, the answer is 1. But I'm not sure.",
            "Let me check for n=6 again. If n=6, the answer would be 1. But suppose you have a hexagon with vertices labeled 1-6. The only way to pair them with equal length segments is to pair opposite vertices: (1-4), (2-5), (3-6). That's one way. But if you consider that you can rotate the pairing, but since the labels are fixed, it's still the same pairing.",
            "Therefore, only one way.\nSo, for n=6, answer is 1. For n=4, answer is 1. For n=24, answer is 1. But maybe the answer is different.",
            "Wait, perhaps there are multiple perfect matchings where each pair is connected by a diagonal of the same length. For example, in a regular 24-gon, if you choose a step difference of 6.",
            "Let's see. If you pair each vertex with the one 6 steps away.",
            "Then, each segment would be of length equal to the distance between vertices 6 steps apart.",
            "Wait, but in a regular 24-gon, the distance between vertices 6 steps apart is the same as the distance between vertices 18 steps apart (since 24-6=18). But the minimal step difference is 6.",
            "So, the length is fixed. Now, if you pair each vertex with the one 6 steps away,",
            "then how many segments would you have? For example, vertex 1 pairs with 7, vertex 7 pairs with 13, vertex 13 pairs with 19, vertex 19 pairs with 1 (since 19 + 6 = 25 mod 24 is 1).",
            "So, this forms a cycle of length 4. Similarly, vertex 2 pairs with 8, 8 pairs with 14, 14 pairs with 20, 20 pairs with 2. Another cycle of length 4. Similarly, vertices 3-9-15-21-3, and",
            "so on.\nSo, there are 6 such cycles of length 4.\nTherefore, you can't form a perfect matching.",
            "Therefore, pairing with step difference 6 is not possible.",
            "Therefore, only step difference 12 works.\nHence, the answer is 1. But why would the problem be asking this",
            "then? Maybe there's a different approach.\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for different configurations where the segments are not necessarily connecting opposite vertices but still have the same length.

            "Wait, for example, in a regular 24-gon, if you choose segments that are all of length corresponding to step difference 1, but arrange them in such a way that they don't overlap. But as before, this would require that the number of vertices is even, but connecting each vertex to the",
            "next one would form a single cycle, which can't be split into pairs.",
            "Therefore, it's impossible. Similarly for other step differences.",
            "Therefore, only step difference 12 works.\nHence, the answer is 1. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is different.",
            "Let me think again.\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of perfect matchings in the graph where edges are of equal length. But in this case, the graph would have edges of various lengths. But the problem says all segments must have equal length.",
            "Therefore, the graph is the set of edges of a particular length. For example,",
            "if we choose the edges of length corresponding to step difference 12,",
            "then the graph consists of 12 edges (the diameters), and the number of perfect matchings is 1. But if there are other lengths that also allow perfect matchings,",

            "Therefore, the answer is 1.\nBut I'm still not confident. Maybe",
            "I should look for another approach.\nLet's think about the problem as a graph theory problem. We have a graph where each vertex is connected to others with certain edges. We need to find the number of perfect matchings in this graph where all edges are of the same length. For a regular 24-gon, the graph is the 24-vertex graph where edges are between vertices with step differences of 1 to 12. For each possible step difference, we can consider the subgraph consisting of edges of that step difference. We need to find for which step differences this subgraph contains a perfect matching, and",
            "then count the number of perfect matchings for each such subgraph.",
            "As we discussed earlier, for step difference d, the subgraph consists of cycles. For example, for step difference d, the number of cycles is gcd(24, d). Each cycle has length 24 / gcd(24, d). For a perfect matching to exist, the number of vertices must be even, which it is (24), and each cycle must have even length. Because a perfect matching requires that each cycle is partitioned into pairs.",

            "then the subgraph has cycles of even length, and\nhence, a perfect matching may exist. But how many perfect matchings are there?",
            "For example, take d=12. gcd(24,12)=12.\nSo, number of cycles is 12, each of length 24/12=2. Each cycle is just two vertices connected by an edge.",
            "Therefore, the subgraph is a perfect matching itself.",
            "Hence, there is exactly 1 perfect matching (the subgraph itself). For d=6, gcd(24,6)=6. Number of cycles is 6, each of length 24/6=4. Each cycle is a 4-cycle. The number of perfect matchings in a 4-cycle is 2 (each 4-cycle has two perfect matchings).",
            "So, for each cycle, we have 2 choices. Since there are 6 cycles, the total number of perfect matchings would be 2^6. But",
            "wait, but the subgraph for d=6 is a union of 6 disjoint 4-cycles. To form a perfect matching, we need to choose a perfect matching from each cycle.

            "Therefore, this would be a valid configuration.\nTherefore, the number of perfect matchings for d=6 is 2^6. Similarly, for other step differences where the cycles are even-length.",
            "Wait, this changes everything! I think I made a mistake earlier. For step difference d, the subgraph consists of gcd(n, d) cycles, each of length n/gcd(n, d). For perfect matchings to exist, each cycle must have even length.",

            "then for each length (except the diameter), there are two step differences. However, the perfect matchings for these step differences would be different. For example, for d=1 and d=23, they have the same length, but the perfect matchings for d=1 and d=23 would be different. But since we are considering the same length, we need to include all perfect matchings for all step differences that correspond to that length.",
            "But this seems complicated. However, the problem states that all segments must have equal lengths.",

But since the problem says \"segments of equal lengths\", it's possible that the same length can be achieved through different step differences, and we need to include all perfect matchings for those step differences.",
            "But this is getting complicated.\nLet's try to approach it systematically.",
            "First, identify all possible lengths. For a regular 24-gon, the possible lengths correspond to step differences from 1 to 12. For step differences d and 24 - d, they have the same length.",
            "So, for d=1 and d=23 (which is 24-1=23), same length. Similarly for d=2 and 22, etc. For d=12, it's the diameter, and there's no other step difference for that length.",
            "Now, for each length, determine the number of perfect matchings. However, for each length, there might be multiple step differences that give that length. For example, length corresponding to step difference 1 and 23. But the subgraphs for step difference 1 and 23 are different.",
            "Wait, but the subgraph for step difference 1 is the set of edges connecting vertices with step difference 1, which is the polygon itself. The subgraph for step difference 23 is the same as step difference 1, since 23 is equivalent to -1 mod 24.",
            "So, the subgraph is the same as step difference 1.",
            "Therefore, the number of perfect matchings for d=1 and d=23 is the same.",
            "Therefore, we can group them together. Similarly for other pairs.",
            "But this is getting too complex.\nLet's think again. For the purpose of the problem, the segments must have equal lengths.",

            "Wait, no. The subgraph for step difference d and n - d are the same, since connecting vertices with step difference d is the same as connecting them with step difference n - d.",
            "Therefore, for each length, there is only one subgraph.",
            "Therefore, we need to consider each length once, and for each length, determine the number of perfect matchings.",

            "So, for d from 1 to 11, each has a corresponding d' = 24 - d.",
            "So, for each length, we have two step differences (except for d=12). However, the subgraph for step difference d and d' are the same, because they are just the same edges in reverse.",
            "Therefore, the number of perfect matchings for d and d' is the same.",
            "Therefore, we can consider each length once, and calculate the number of perfect matchings for that length.",
            "But how does this affect our calculation?\nLet's consider all possible lengths and calculate the number of perfect matchings for each.",
            "First, for the diameter (d=12), the subgraph is 12 edges connecting opposite vertices. As discussed earlier, this is a perfect matching itself,",
            "so there is 1 perfect matching.\nFor other lengths, we need to consider step differences d from 1 to 11, and for each d, calculate the number of perfect matchings in the subgraph of edges with step difference d.

However, since the subgraphs are the same, we can calculate for d from 1 to 11, and multiply by 1 (since each length is covered once).",
            "Wait, but no. For example, for d=1 and d=23, they are the same subgraph.",
            "So, we should only consider d=1 to 11, and for each, calculate the number of perfect matchings.",
            "But earlier, we saw that for step difference d, the subgraph consists of gcd(24, d) cycles, each of length 24 / gcd(24, d). For a perfect matching to exist, each cycle must have even length.",

However, in a square, the two perfect matchings would be the two diagonals.",

Because the perfect matchings in the subgraph for step difference d are not necessarily using edges of step difference d.",
            "Wait, no!\nWait, the subgraph for step difference d includes only edges of step difference d.",

            "Therefore, for n=4, d=1 gives 2 perfect matchings, and d=2 gives 1 perfect matching. Total of 3. But in reality, the only valid perfect matchings where all segments have equal length are the two diagonals (d=2), and the two ways to pair adjacent vertices (d=1). But",

            "Let's think about that. For d=6, the subgraph consists of 6 cycles of length 4. Each cycle has 2 perfect matchings.",
            "So, 2^6=64. That seems correct.\nSimilarly, for d=3, the subgraph consists of 3 cycles of length 8. Each cycle has 2 perfect matchings,",
            "so 2^3=8. Correct.\nSo, the calculation seems correct.",

            "But I'm not sure if this is the correct answer.\nLet me check another source or think of another way.",
            "Alternatively, the total number of perfect matchings in the complete graph on 24 vertices is (23)!! = 23 \u00d7 21 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1, which is a huge number. But the problem restricts to perfect matchings where all edges have the same length.",

            "Actually, this problem is similar to the problem of counting the number of binary strings of length n with k ones and no three consecutive ones.

            "However, there's a known recurrence for this problem.",
            "Let me recall that for the number of binary strings of length n with k ones and no three consecutive ones, the recurrence is:",
            "f(n, k) = f(n-1, k) + f(n-1, k-1) - f(n-3, k-3)\nWait, I'm not sure.",
            "Let me think of small cases.\nFor example, n=3, k=3: f(3,3) = 0. Using the recurrence, f(3,3) = f(2,3) + f(2,2) - f(0,0). But f(2,3)=0, f(2,2)=1, f(0,0)=1.",
            "So 0 + 1 - 1 = 0, which is correct.\nFor n=3, k=2: f(3,2) = f(2,2) + f(2,1) - f(0, -1).",

            "Let's compute using the recurrence:\nf(4,2) = f(3,2) + f(3,1) - f(1, -1). Since f(1,-1)=0, it's f(3,2) + f(3,1). f(3,2)=3, f(3,1)=3 (since there are 3 ways to choose 1 chair out of 3 with no three consecutive, which is all possible).",
            "So 3 + 3 = 6, which is correct.\nSo the recurrence seems to work.",
            "Let me try to apply it to compute f(16,8). But this would require building a table from n=0 to 16 and k=0 to 8. This is time-consuming, but perhaps we can find a pattern or use the previous result.",

            "Let me think again about the block method.\nThe block method assumes that the number of ways is the sum over m of C(m, k-m) * C(n - k + 1, m). For n=16, k=8, this gives 2907.",
            "Let me check if there's a mistake in the calculation of the terms.",
