# @package dataset
# MBPP+ dataset configuration
#
# MBPP+ (Mostly Basic Python Problems Plus) is an enhanced version of MBPP
# with 35x more test cases for rigorous evaluation of code generation.
#
# Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/evalplus/mbppplus
# EvalPlus: https://github.com/evalplus/evalplus
# - 378 coding problems (test split)
# - Each problem: prompt -> function implementation

dataset_path: "evalplus/mbppplus"
dataset_split: "test"  # 378 problems
subset: null  # Only process first N samples (null for all)
prompt_file: ./config/prompts/mbpp_plus.txt
answer_format: "code"  # Code generation format
question_field: "prompt"  # Field containing the problem prompt
answer_field: "code"  # Field containing the reference solution
data_name: "mbpp_plus"  # Used for evaluation routing

# Additional fields available in each instance:
# - task_id: Unique identifier (e.g., "Mbpp/2")
# - code: Reference solution
# - prompt: Problem description
# - test: Complete test code (from EvalPlus)
# - test_list: List of basic test assertions
# - test_imports: Required imports for tests
