# LLM Critic Scorer (based on Tree of Thoughts State Evaluator)
# Based on "Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models"
# Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601

type: llm_critic

# Evaluation method: "value" or "vote"
# - value: Evaluates each step independently (sure/likely/unlikely/impossible)
# - vote: Presents all candidates and asks which is most promising
method: value

# Number of evaluation samples for aggregation (paper uses 3)
n_evaluate_sample: 3

# Sampling temperature for evaluation
temperature: 0.7

# Maximum tokens for evaluation response
max_tokens: 300

# Timeout in seconds for API calls
timeout: 60

# Prompt files (relative to config/prompts/, or absolute path)
