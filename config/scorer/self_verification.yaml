# Self-Verification Scorer (Tree of Thoughts)
# Based on "Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models"
# Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601

type: self_verification

# Evaluation method: "value" or "vote"
# - value: Evaluates each step independently (sure/likely/unlikely/impossible)
# - vote: Presents all candidates and asks which is most promising
method: value

# Number of evaluation samples for aggregation (paper uses 3)
n_evaluate_sample: 3

# Sampling temperature for evaluation
temperature: 0.7

# Maximum tokens for evaluation response
max_tokens: 100

# Timeout in seconds for API calls
timeout: 60

# Score aggregation method when n_evaluate_sample > 1
# Options: "sum" (original ToT paper), "min" (conservative - any "impossible" vetoes),
#          "mean" (average), "max" (optimistic)
score_aggregation: sum

# Prompt files (relative to config/prompts/, or absolute path)

vote_prompt_file: "tree-of-thought/self_verification/vote_prompt.txt"

# Direct prompt strings (override files if set)
# value_prompt: null
