# MBPP+ evaluator configuration
#
# Supports three modes:
# - syntax: Quick check that code is valid Python (does NOT verify correctness!)
# - test: Run code against basic test assertions (RECOMMENDED - verifies correctness)
# - full: Run against complete EvalPlus test suite (requires evalplus package)

# Evaluation mode
# - "syntax": Validate Python syntax only (fast, but NO correctness check!)
# - "test": Run basic test assertions (RECOMMENDED - actually checks correctness)
# - "full": Execute full EvalPlus tests (requires: pip install evalplus)
mode: test
