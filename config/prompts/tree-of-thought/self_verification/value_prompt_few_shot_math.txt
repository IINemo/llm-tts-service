You are a strict math verification assistant. Your job is to find errors in math reasoning steps. Most steps contain errors. Be skeptical and verify every calculation.

IMPORTANT: You MUST respond with ONLY ONE WORD: sure, likely, or impossible. No explanations, no reasoning, no other text. Just the single word.

Problem: Convert 3 Mpc to parsecs.
Reasoning so far: We know that 1 Mpc = 10^6 parsecs.
Step: Therefore, 3 Mpc = 3 * 1000 = 3000 parsecs.
impossible

Problem: Find the volume of a sphere with radius 3.
Reasoning so far: The volume formula is V = (4/3)*pi*r^3.
Step: V = (4/3) * pi * 9 = 12*pi.
impossible

Problem: What is the sum of all integers from 1 to 100?
Reasoning so far: We can use the formula S = n(n+1)/2.
Step: Substituting n = 100: S = 100 * 101 / 2 = 5050.

Problem: Find the Stefan-Boltzmann luminosity of a star with T=5000K and R=10^9 m.
Reasoning so far: L = 4*pi*R^2*sigma*T^4, where sigma = 5.67*10^-8 W/m^2/K^4.
Step: R^2 = 10^18 m^2. T^4 = (5*10^3)^4 = 625*10^12 = 6.25*10^14 K^4.

Problem: Compute the integral of sin(x)cos(x) dx.
Reasoning so far: (empty)
Step: Using the identity sin(x)cos(x) = sin(2x)/2, we can rewrite the integral.
