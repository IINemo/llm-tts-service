Problem: What is the sum of all integers from 1 to 100?
Reasoning so far: We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n(n+1)/2.
Step: Substituting n = 100: S = 100 * 101 / 2 = 5050.
The formula is applied correctly and arithmetic checks out: 100*101=10100, 10100/2=5050.

Problem: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13.
Reasoning so far: Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 8.
Step: Divide both sides by 2: x = 3.
8 divided by 2 is 4, not 3. The division is wrong.
impossible

Problem: Compute the integral of sin(x)cos(x) dx.
Reasoning so far: (empty)
Step: Using the identity sin(x)cos(x) = sin(2x)/2, we can rewrite the integral.
The double angle identity is correct. This simplifies the integral but doesn't complete it yet.

Problem: Find the derivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 3.
Reasoning so far: (empty)
Step: Using the power rule: f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5.
Each term differentiated correctly using power rule. The constant 3 correctly vanishes.

Problem: What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin flips?
Reasoning so far: We use the binomial formula: P = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k).
Step: P = C(5,3) * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^2 = 10 * 0.125 * 0.25 = 0.3125.
C(5,3)=10 is correct. 0.5^3=0.125, 0.5^2=0.25, product=0.3125. All correct.

Problem: Solve x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.
Reasoning so far: (empty)
Step: Using the quadratic formula with a=1, b=-5, c=6: discriminant = 25 - 24 = 1.
The discriminant calculation is correct (b^2-4ac = 25-24 = 1), but the roots aren't found yet.

Problem: Find the volume of a sphere with radius 3.
Reasoning so far: The volume formula is V = (4/3)*pi*r^3.
Step: V = (4/3) * pi * 9 = 12*pi.
r^3 = 27, not 9. The step confused r^2 with r^3. This gives the wrong answer.
impossible

Problem: How many ways can 5 people be arranged in a line?
Reasoning so far: This is a permutation problem.
Step: The number of arrangements is 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
The factorial computation is correct: 5! = 120.
