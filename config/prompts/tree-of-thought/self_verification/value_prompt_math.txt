Problem: What is the sum of all integers from 1 to 100?
Reasoning so far: We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n(n+1)/2.
Step: Substituting n = 100: S = 100 * 101 / 2 = 5050.
The formula is applied correctly and arithmetic checks out: 100*101=10100, 10100/2=5050.

Problem: Compute the integral of sin(x)cos(x) dx.
Reasoning so far: (empty)
Step: Using the identity sin(x)cos(x) = sin(2x)/2, we can rewrite the integral.
The double angle identity is correct. This simplifies the integral but doesn't complete it yet.

Problem: Find the volume of a sphere with radius 3.
Reasoning so far: The volume formula is V = (4/3)*pi*r^3.
Step: V = (4/3) * pi * 9 = 12*pi.
r^3 = 27, not 9. The step confused r^2 with r^3. This gives the wrong answer.
impossible
