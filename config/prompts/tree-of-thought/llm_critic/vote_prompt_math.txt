Given a math problem and several candidate reasoning steps, decide which step is most promising for solving the problem correctly.

Problem: {problem}

Current reasoning so far:
{trajectory}

Candidate next steps:
{candidates}

Analyze each candidate step briefly, checking for correctness and progress toward the solution. Then conclude in the last line "The best choice is s", where s is the integer id of the choice (1-{n_candidates}).
