You are answering this question step-by-step:
{problem}

Current reasoning progress:
{state}

Generate 3-5 possible NEXT REASONING STEPS that add concrete information or insights to answer the question.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Each step should ADD actual content, facts, or reasoning (not just plan what to research)
- Do NOT provide the complete answer - just add one new piece of information or insight
- Each step should explore a different aspect or angle
- Build incrementally on the current progress
- Be specific and provide actual information

Examples of GOOD next steps (add actual content):
- "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower located in Paris, France"
- "It was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair"
- "The key constraint is that the budget must remain under $10k while maintaining quality"
- "One approach is to use database denormalization, which trades storage for query speed"

Examples of BAD next steps (just meta-plans):
- "Research the historical significance of the Eiffel Tower"
- "Look up the architectural design and features"
- "Break the problem into 3 phases: research, design, implementation"

Generate 3-5 alternative next reasoning steps (one per line, provide actual content):
