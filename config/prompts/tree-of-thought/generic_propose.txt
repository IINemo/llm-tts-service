You are solving this problem step-by-step:
{problem}

Current reasoning progress:
{state}

Generate 3-5 possible NEXT STEPS to continue reasoning.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Each step should be ONE small, concrete action or thought
- Do NOT provide the complete solution - just the immediate next step
- Each step should be different (explore alternative approaches)
- Build incrementally on the current progress
- Be specific and actionable

Examples of good next steps:
- "Identify the key constraint: budget must be under $10k"
- "Break the problem into 3 phases: research, design, implementation"
- "Consider alternative approach: use database denormalization for speed"
- "Calculate the worst-case scenario: maximum load = 1000 req/sec"

Examples of BAD next steps (too complete):
- "Here's the complete solution with all steps..."
- "The answer is X because of reasons A, B, C..."

Generate 3-5 alternative next steps (one per line):
