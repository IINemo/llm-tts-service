Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. Given an input and an answer, give a judgement (sure/impossible) if the answer is correct, i.e. it uses each input exactly once and no other numbers, and reach 24.
Input: 4 4 6 8
Answer: (4 + 8) * (6 - 4) = 24
Judge:
sure
Input: 2 9 10 12
Answer: 2 * 12 * (10 - 9) = 24
Judge:
sure
Input: 4 9 10 13
Answer: (13 - 9) * (10 - 4) = 24
Judge:
sure
Input: 4 4 6 8
Answer: (4 + 8) * (6 - 4) + 1 = 25
Judge:
impossible
Input: 2 9 10 12
Answer: 2 * (12 - 10) = 24
Judge:
impossible
Input: 4 9 10 13
Answer: (13 - 4) * (10 - 9) = 24
