# Math evaluation dependencies (for reference)
# These are installed in the main environment via setup.sh / pip install
#
# Note: ANTLR version mismatch warnings will appear but functionality is correct:
#   - Hydra uses antlr4-python3-runtime==4.9.3
#   - latex2sympy2 was built with antlr4-python3-runtime==4.7.2
#
# Core dependencies:
# sympy==1.12
# regex>=2023.0.0
# latex2sympy2>=1.9.1  (installed with --no-deps to avoid pulling antlr4==4.7.2)
