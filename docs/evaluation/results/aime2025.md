## DeepConf

### Qwen3-8B - December 2025

**Configuration**:
- Strategy: DeepConf Offline
- Budget: 16 traces
- Filter: top10
- Window: 2048
- Temperature: 0.7
- Max tokens: 24576

**Config file**: `config/experiments/deepconf/deepconf_qwen3_aime2025.yaml`

#### Results

| Sample Range | Accuracy | Correct/Total | Output Directory |
|--------------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| 0-7 | TBD | X/8 | `outputs/2025-12-02/aime2025_deepconf_0_7_23-09-01/` |
| 8-9 | TBD | X/2 | `outputs/2025-12-02/aime2025_deepconf_8_15_23-09-03/` |
| 10-12 | TBD | X/3 | `outputs/2025-12-03/aime2025_deepconf_10_12_15-29-39/` |
| 13-15 | TBD | X/3 | `outputs/2025-12-03/aime2025_deepconf_13_15_15-29-50/` |
| **Total (0-15)** | **TBD** | **X/16** | - |

**WandB**: TBD

**Notes**:
- Experiments split across multiple runs due to GPU availability
- Using sequential generation with early stopping (not batched due to KV cache constraints)
- Max tokens reduced from 32768 to 24576 to prevent OOM

## Self-Consistency

### Qwen3-8B - December 2025

**Configuration**:
- Strategy: Self-Consistency
- Num paths: 16
- Temperature: 0.7
- Selection: Majority voting

**Config file**: `config/experiments/self_consistency/sc_qwen3_aime2025.yaml`

#### Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | TBD |
| Avg Tokens/Sample | TBD |
| Total Samples | 30 |

**WandB**: TBD

**Output**: TBD

**Notes**:
- Pending completion of DeepConf experiments
